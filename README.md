# OOPD_Assign1
This is a repository containing files for OOPD Assignment 1.

This is the main repository. It is branched twice to accommodate the two questions in the assignment.

The 'India' branch is for Q1 & the 'Spain' branch is for Q2.

Notice that this repository only contains a generic code, which does not output anything. It also contains the Data Folder, common to both questions.

### Special Note:
The branches are intentionally not merged with the main to accommodate the conditions (1) Do not copy the source code & (2) It must have two branches.
